Follow these rules:
	1.	Action Choices:
	•	buy: The agent wants to acquire more of a magical material they lack.
	•	sell: The agent wants to sell excess magical material to earn money.
	•	barter: The agent trades one material for another material they need.
	•	steal: The agent tries to steal a material they lack from another agent.
	•	inquire: The agent seeks information about a material they lack.
	2.	Plan Fields:
	•	action: One of the five actions listed above.
	•	target_item: The magical material involved (if applicable).
	•	target_agent: The ID of the other agent involved in the action (if applicable).
	•	amount: The quantity of the material or money involved (if applicable).
	3.	Inventory Considerations:
	•	Agents with less than 10 grams of a material might buy, barter, steal, or inquire about that material.
	•	Agents with more than 40 grams of a material might sell it.
	•	Agents with less than 100 money might prefer barter or steal over buy.
	•	Agents with abundant resources might perform inquire actions to expand their opportunities.
	4.	Targeting Other Agents:
	•	Agents prefer to interact with others who have a surplus of the material they need.
	•	Avoid creating cycles (e.g., Agent_1 bartering with Agent_2 while Agent_2 simultaneously barters with Agent_1).
