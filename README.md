# AI RPG

This is a playground where I hope to using building a game to help me think through what AI agents will need to be able to do. This game uses Ollama and Llama 3.2 5b to run a local LLM.

## General idea

The initial goal of this game is create a number of NPCs and locations with some specific properties that must be perserved, and for those NPCs to be able to act (acquire items for example), and interact with PCs.

## Notes

### Jan 4 

Restarting this project again. Originally started it in Go, but decided it would be easier in Python. Use ChatGPT to help create the characters and then did a bunch of testing. The characters are too complex, need to work on the agent planner.

### Jan 5

Started playing with the concept of a "planner".
